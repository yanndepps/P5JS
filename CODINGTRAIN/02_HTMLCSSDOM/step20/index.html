		From CartoonBrew :
		<blockquote class="txt">
			Carter Goodrich is an artist who creates illustrations for childrenâ€™s books, editorial illustrations for magazines, and character designs for animated films. He has contributed designs to films such as The Croods, Brave, Open Season, and Finding Nemo, among others.
			I love Goodrich's scritchy-scratchy style. Scribbling layer upon layer of loose, lyrical lines, he creates gloriously grotesque caricatures teeming with body hair and a Pigpen-like aura of filth. His work is textbook timeless. It wouldn't look out of place in a 1960's underground comic, yet it could also be featured in a 2023 exhibition of experimental animation. Think of the most metal kid in your junior high school. Give him the drawing ability of Da Vinci circa The Vitruvian Man. Now let him scrawl all over your math book for the duration of detention. The end result would look something like Goodrich's deliriously devilish doodles.
